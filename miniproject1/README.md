# Elecanisms Miniproject 1: Haptic Joystick
**Logan Sweet**
Due: Tuesday, February 13

### Introduction ###
The goal of this project is to create a haptic joystick with one degree of freedom. The mechanical system of the joystick will be controlled by a DC motor, which will provide the torque on the joystick itself. The motor's position will be recorded with a magnetic rotary encoder, and the entire system will be controlled by the PIC24 microcontroller on the elecanisms board.
